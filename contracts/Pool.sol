/// @notice Funding pool contract. Automatically sends funds to a configurable set of receivers.
///
/// The contract has 2 types of users: the senders and the receivers.
///
/// A sender has some funds and a set of addresses of receivers, to whom he wants to send funds.
/// In order to send there are 3 conditions, which must be fulfilled:
///
/// 1. There must be funds on his account in this contract.
///    They can be added with `topUp` and removed with `withdraw`.
/// 2. Total amount sent to the receivers every second must be set to a non-zero value.
///    This is done with `setAmtPerSec`.
/// 3. A set of receivers must be non-empty.
///    Receivers can be added, removed and updated with `setReceiver`.
///    Each receiver has a weight, which is used to calculate how the total sent amount is split.
///
/// Each of these functions can be called in any order and at any time, they have immediate effects.
/// When all of these conditions are fulfilled, every second the configured amount is being sent.
/// It's extracted from the `withdraw`able balance and transferred to the receivers.
/// The process continues automatically until the sender's balance is empty.
///
/// A receiver has an account, from which he can `collect` funds sent by the senders.
/// The available amount is updated every `cycleSecs` seconds,
/// so recently sent funds may not be `collect`able immediately.
/// `cycleSecs` is a constant configured when the pool is deployed.
///
/// A single address can be used as a sender and as a receiver, even at the same time.
/// It will have 2 balances in the contract, one with funds being sent and one with received,
/// but with no connection between them and no shared configuration.
/// In order to send received funds, they must be first `collect`ed and then `topUp`ped
/// if they are to be sent through the contract.
///
/// The concept of something happening periodically, e.g. every second or every `cycleSecs` are
/// only high-level abstractions for the user, Ethereum isn't really capable of scheduling work.
/// The actual implementation emulates that behavior by calculating the results of the scheduled
/// events based on how many seconds have passed and only when a user needs their outcomes.
